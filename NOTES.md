- Thinking in Python: Insights, Idioms and Patterns
- Remove sections; any essay can appear in the order it makes sense (patterns will probably be at the back, though)
- chapter on testing, then set up testing for examples throughout the book
- chapter on optional static typing, so that can be used throughout

- For anything graphical, is it possible to use [http://py.processing.org](http://py.processing.org)?
  It appears it might require Jython, which limits it to Python 2.7.
